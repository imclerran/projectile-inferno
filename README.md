__Projectile Inferno__ is a bullet hell game originally devloped by Team _DROP TABLE teams_ for CS487 at Washington State University. The game makes use of a custom built Entity-Component-System framework, which allows game objects to be composed, rather than inherited, which helps reduce complex inheritance trees and Liskov substitution violations.
